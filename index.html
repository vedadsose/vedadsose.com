        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a software engineer at heart who loves products and loves to
          build. Right now my main focus is serving as CTO and Co-Founder of
          OriginalVoices, where I’m leading the charge in scaling real-time
          audience intelligence powered by Digital Twins.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Before OriginalVoices I worked with both fast-moving startups and
          large companies, while always tinkering with personal projects on the
          side. OriginalVoices came as the culmination of years of collaboration
          with my co-founder, a vision we knew we had to bring to life.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I believe in a builder’s mindset. Leaders should stay close to the
          product and the code. For me it’s about building strong teams,
          designing scalable architecture, and fostering a culture where ideas
          can quickly become reality.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Outside of work I’m passionate about sports: skiing, mountain biking,
          and especially padel. I’m lucky to have a supportive wife who keeps me
          grounded as we navigate this journey together.
